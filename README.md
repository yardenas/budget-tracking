# Tracking my budget
I developed this dashboard to increase my awareness on my money savings.

## Budget Items and Actual spendings
Manipulating the different budget items (for instance, how much money do I spend on house rent) is done via the budget table.
Adding and editing new expenses or income is done similarly via the actuals table.

The tables are persistant and are saved locally (@localStorage cookies).
